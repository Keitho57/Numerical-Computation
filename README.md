# 🧮 Numerical Computation 🤖 [WIP]

Keith O'Hanlon - Maynooth University - 2023

Maynooth University CS417 - Numerical Computation

This is a flask app with NextJs with TypeScript and Tailwind. The reasoning behind this stack is that i wanted access to Numpy to do 
complex aritmatic and matrix manipulation.

To any future students who might find this: This repo contains all algoritms and content taught during the CS417 Numerical Computation
module at Maynooth University as of 2023. The algoritms are handled by python on the server side and presented visually using NextJs
on the client side.

I use Numpy to handle all the calculations and send them back to the frontend in a JSON object.

Good Luck! 🍀 ** You'll need it. **
